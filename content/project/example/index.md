title: Real-time Human Pose Imitation on Baxter Robot
summary:
  -  Utilized BlazePose for 3D human pose extraction, which was used to calculate essential joint angles to translate the pose on Baxter Robot in KinEval(a ROS like middleware system) simulation environment.

Utilized BlazePose for 3D human pose extraction, which was used to calculate essential joint angles to translate the pose on Baxter Robot in KinEval(a ROS like middleware system) simulation environment.

Established real-time communication via Flask between Python script and KinEval. Implemented proportional controls
in KinEval to allow smooth replication of human poses on Simulated Baxter Robot.
